# throttle 

A social media app built using TypeScript, Expo, and react-native. 

_This is in a very early prototype stage. Currently working on Firebase auth, hosting, and database. As such, there is no live demo available yet._

This project is my foray in learning react-native. Ultimately, it's a simple premise: A social media app similar to Twitter, but users are **throttle**d to posting and commenting once a day. In turn, per post limitations are slightly lifted to allow for longer posts and comments.
